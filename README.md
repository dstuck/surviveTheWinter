Test game for playing with AI

So far only a basic implementation using SFML Windows and help from this tutorial: http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Game-From-Scratch-CPP-Edition-The-Introduction.aspx

Basic game has movement controls, collision detection and heuristic for curious AI. Added enemy which attacks other characters and an apple that can be picked up and put down with space.

As of 9/8/18 I'm leaving this project as completed
